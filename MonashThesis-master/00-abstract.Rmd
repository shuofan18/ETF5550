# Abstract {-}

When we fit a linear regression model, with one continuous dependent variable and some explanatory variables, many problems may occur. For example, the relationship between dependent-explanatory is not linear; the error terms may be correlated to each other; the variance of errors may not be constant; outliers and high leverage points may be present, etc. Plots of residuals versus predicted (or fitted) value are a useful graphical tool for detecting most of the problems [@ISL13]. It can be difficult for beginners to learn how to recognize patterns seen could arise by chance and that the model is proper.

Computer vision has advanced rapidly in recent years, primarily by building deep learning models.

Therefore, in this paper, we are going to investigate whether deep learning neural network could be used to teach a computer to do better than a human on reading residual plots. Two of the issues, non-linearity and heteroskedasticity, will be addressed here. After training the model, we will compare its performance with human database.
