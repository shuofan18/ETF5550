# Abstract {-}  

Residuals plots are a primary means to diagnose statistical models. It requires human evaluation to determine if structure in the plot is consistent with random variation or not. If not, then the diagnosis is that that model has not adequately captured the relationships between response and explanatory variable in the data.

This thesis develops a computer vision model to read residual plots. It compares results with a large database of human evaluations.

The evaluations were conducted using a protocol called the "lineup" which places residual plots in a formal framework for statistical hypothesis testing. The comparison between computer and human is made on a very restricted and controlled set of residual plot structures. A new small human subject study is also conducted to compare human vs. computer in reading heteroscedasticity.
