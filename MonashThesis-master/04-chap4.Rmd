# Conclusion 

SUMMARISE RESULTS BRIEFLY
The convnet can be trained to perform similarly to human perception, when the structure in the residual plots is very specific. Performance on the linear vs no structure is comparable to the human subjects results. Performance on detecting heteroskedasticity is also good. 

SUMMARISE OTHER FINDINGS BRIEFLY
Performance of the convnet exceeds the results obtained by a $t$-test. 

# Discussion

- Training of the convnet requires many images. Time to train the model was long.

- Other types of structure: could we have many classes of structure? 

- How would you expand the experiment to build a model for general residual plot reading?
