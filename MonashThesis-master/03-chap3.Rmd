# Comparison with Turk studies

A large database of results from a human subjects test conducted to validate the lineup protocol relative to a classical tests is going to be used for this part of the work. This data was collected as part of the work presented in @MM13. Experiment 2 examined the performance of humans in recognising linear association between two variables, in direct comparison to conducting a $t$-test of $H_o: \beta_k=0$ vs $H_a: \beta_k\neq 0$ assessing the importance of including variable $k$ in the linear model. An example lineup is shown in Figure \ref{expt2}. For this lineup, 63 of the 65 people who examined it selected the data plot (position 20) from the null plots. There is clear evidence that the data displayed in plot 20 is not from $H_o: \beta_k=0$.

\end{figure*}



This experiment utilised 70 lineups of size 20 plot, with varying degrees of departure from the $H_o: \beta_k=0$. There were 351 evaluations by human subjects. These results will be used for comparison with the deep learning model. 

The trained deep learning model will be applied to the data from this experiment. The model will be asked classify each plot in each lineup. We will calculate how frequently the data plot is selected as not a null plot, and compare this to the frequencies obtained by human evaluation. 

## Classify samples using our model

After first training attempt with 40,000 observations (20,000 of each class), the model's performance is shown below.

```{r}
model <- load("/Users/stanza/Documents/GitHub/ETF5550/MonashThesis-master/data/model.RData")
summary(model)
```
